# Codyssi Solutions (codyssi-solutions)

My solutions to Codyssi programming puzzles 
(<https://www.codyssi.com/>). 

## Prerequisites:

1. Python 3 (last tested with version 3.12.3)

## Getting Started:

```
git clone https://github.com/William-D-Jones/codyssi-solutions.git
```

## Usage:

Each Python program accepts a single command-line input, which is the name
of the file containing the day's input. For example, run 2024 day 1 with:

```
python3 2024/day1.py 2024/input-2024-1.txt
```

Most programs three lines of output, which are the answers to Parts 1, 2, and 3.
